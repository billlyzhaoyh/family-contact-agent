## Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up the development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a feature branch** for your changes
5. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
6. **Test your changes** thoroughly
7. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip
- Go (for WhatsApp bridge components)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/family-contact-agent.git
   cd family-contact-agent
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended) - One command setup
   make setup

   # Or manually:
   # Create virtual environment and sync dependencies
   uv sync
   # Install package in editable mode with dev dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install

   # Activate the virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

### Dependency Management

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. Here are the key commands for development:

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
# Complete setup (recommended)
make setup

# Or step by step:
uv sync                    # Sync dependencies from lock file
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" # Install package in editable mode
```

**Adding/Removing Dependencies:**
```bash
# Add a new dependency
uv add package-name

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev package-name

# Remove a dependency
uv remove package-name

# Update all dependencies
uv sync
```

**Common Development Commands:**
```bash
make sync           # Sync dependencies from lock file
make install-dev    # Install dev dependencies in editable mode
make test           # Run tests
make format         # Format code
```

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your change is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** if you're planning a significant change
3. **Discuss the approach** with maintainers for major features

### Code Style

This project follows strict code style guidelines:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting and import sorting
- **Type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings** for all public functions and classes

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality together
- Use descriptive file and function names
- Follow the existing project structure
- Add tests for new functionality

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific_file.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test patterns
- Aim for good test coverage

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test your changes manually:

1. **Test the specific functionality** you changed
