## Overview
Some family members often communicate in voice notes, but not everyone speaks the same language. This project brings together open source tools to translate, transcribe, and deliver messages so everyone can participate in the conversation.

## Features
- Translate voice notes between languages
- Text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for Cantonese
- WhatsApp integration for seamless message delivery

## Architecture
This project integrates several open source components:
- [Bedrock Translation Agent](https://github.com/aws-samples/bedrock-translation-agent/tree/main)
- [WhatsApp MCP Server](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp)
- Canto TTS components from [hon9kon9ize](https://huggingface.co/hon9kon9ize) and [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hon9kon9ize/tts/tree/main)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add Cantonese ASR so voice notes can be transcribed and translated back to English
- [ ] Integrate WhatsApp MCP server into the main agent for prompt-based message sending/receiving
- [ ] Improve error handling and user experience
- [ ] Add web UI for easier interaction
